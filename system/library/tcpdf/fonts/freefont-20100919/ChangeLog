	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Sinhala: Fixed one lookup table mistake, and a couple of glpyh
		omissions, that Harshula pointed out.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Sans: Applied Daniel Johnsons improvement to capital Eng to Sans, as
	described in previous commits.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd:

	Coptic: added alphabet to bold.  Accent marks not working -- a mystery.
	Some tweeks in medium face as well.
	
	glyph cleanup -- points too close, some glyphs outside bounding boxes.

2010-09-17 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Sinhala: tightened up left side of na and derivatives.
	tighened up left sides of u, lla, na, dha, ndha, nya, jnya
	tightened up some of the vowel conjuncts, and left side of nna.

2010-09-16 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Coptic: fiddled about with letter forms, striving for a kind of
	consistency.
	
	Sinhala: Harshula noticed four incorrect combined forms.  Fixed these.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Latin Extended-A: Applied Daniel Johnson's patch that made two versions
	of capital Eng.  His explanation:
		'
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8A
	
		The form of capital Eng currently in all three FreeFont faces
		is that used by the Sami people, resembling a capital N with a
		hooked right descender.
		However, the form preferred for African and Amerindian
		languages resembles a tall lowercase n with a hook that almost
		meets the left vertical.  (See wikipedia link above for a
		visual.)
	
		Recommend moving the existing Sami-style Eng to a PUA or
		non-Unicode slot, creating African-style Eng at U+014A, and
		adding a LOCL table with substitution rules for
		Inari Sami (ISM), Lule Sami (LSM),
		Northern Sami (NSM) and Skolt Sami (SKS).
		'
	Latin Extended-B: Also in his patch:
		added U+0220 (Latin Capital Letter N with long leg)

2010-09-15 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Latin for Sami: Daniel Johnson's patch added alternative form of Eng for
		African languages and a 'local' table for the Sami form.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Sinhala: regularized kundaliya a bit.
	re-named a few more ligature glyphs, for consistency

	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Put stray lookup into its proper subtable.

	Gurmukhi: improved some names of ligature glyphs, and found one
	apparently doubled table entry (kagurmukhi_nuktagurmukhi.nukt  now 
	gur_ka.nukt)

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Various measures to fix problems FontForge Find Problems reports under
	ATT, including a mass glyph rename of Sinhala ligatures.

	There are still a few lookup table issues in FreeSerif and FreeSans though.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Re-named some of the Sinhala lookups in somewhat better way.
	Control Pictures: added a bunch (but... is it worth it?)

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Buginese: lookup tables and glyphs to re-order vowels, courtesy of
	          Mohammad Anwari.

	Sinhala: complete replacement of range with glyphs extracted more
	directly from Yannis Haralambous' sinha TeX font (last version was
	also derived from this font, but had undergone detrimental processing).
	Implements "rak" glyphs using three GSUB lookup steps.

	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Osmanya: courtesy of Daniel Johnson.

	Note this script is slanted in every sample I've seen.  That is
	justification enough that the glyphs in this range look slated,
	although the face isn't oblique.

	UCAS Extended: by Daniel Johnson

2010-09-05 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Fix for FontForge warning (v 20090923)
	
	"On Windows many apps will have problems with this font's kerning,
	because because 58 of its glyph kern pairs cannot be mapped to
	unicode-BMP kern pairs"
	
	This was due to kern tables for the Musical Symbols range, which isn't
	in the Unicode Basic Multilingual Plane.
	
	Removed this lookup.  Might consider another way to position these
	symbols.

	direction in some lookups.

2010-08-20 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Resolves class of validation problems in Sinhala: Bad Glyph Name.
	
	This is a FontForge bug, that appears when certain types of problems
	occur in the glyph contours.  Probably an arithmetic error causes some
	corruption.

	Corrected missing extrema in recent Latin Extended-D range

	Sinhala: re-did previous patch using a more recent one.
	Un-did some other glyph changes that didn't help much anyway.

	* FreeMono.sfd:

	Named letters in several ranges... should write a script for this...

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Vietamese:  In roman and sans, lookups are basically functional now.
	Used 'ccmp' Ligature Substitution to form stacked marks (inasmuch as
	glyphs for the stacked Unicode codepoints are available)
	Adjusted positioning of some marks.
	Named many letters and combining marks.

	Corrected some language names
	A bit o kerning

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd:

	Fixed problem with name.  This should be the same as before the revision
	except for the fix.
	The KDE font installer was saying this face was incorrectly named
	Free Serif Bold Italic, but this wasn't quite correct.  One of the other
	language names said it was named Free Serif Halvfett Kursiv, which
	conflicted with that language name for the real Free Serif Bold Italic.

	Regression:  for some unknown reason, previous release gets built so
	that my system thinks it is Free Serif Bold Italic.
	This is a mystery.  There is nothing about Italic in the file.

	1) in response to FontForge complain that large names tables conflict
	   with recent Windows patches

	(Hope to post the list of sample texts elsewhere, because I like the idea.)

2010-03-02 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Latin standard ligatures: in non-bold, promoted dlig to liga.
		Put standard Dutch IJ in all; Adjusted spacing a bit

2010-02-28 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Cyrillic: further revision of spacing, in direction of loosening.
	bold ze was strangely thin; made bolder.

2010-02-27 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Cyrillic: reviewed spacing of whole range, generally loosened slightly

	at
	0x0000 0x0001 0x000D

	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?28742

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Added at 0x0000 0x0001 0x000D characters
	         .notdef .null nonmarkingreturn
	These are NOT UNICODE they are to satisfy an essentially undocumented
	"feature" of FontForge, ( in source tottf.c, AssignNotdefNull() )
	And a funny strong suggestion of TrueType fonts, that they begin with
	three special characters (evidently different from encoding slots)
	http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/recom.htm
	
	FontForge looks for these glyphs in certain places and copies them.
	Otherwise, apparently, it will find a glyph elsewhere (unclear how) and
	copy it there, possibly resulting in something quite wrong
	(such as a non-monospace font).
	
	The three are copied to the end of TTF fonts (only one to the end of OTF
	fonts)

2009-03-05 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Glagolitic: more fiddling.  Raised small letters so their tops are
	even with the tops of the big letters, which is more in line with
	their "hanging" nature, and with most manuscripts.

2009-03-04 Stevan_White
	* tools/ranges.py:

	ranges for Sinhala

2009-03-03 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

2009-02-28 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Sinhala: replaced U+0DD0-1 with ones from sinha font

	Glagolitic: Additions, improvements (Note: the characters still missing
	I simply haven't yet recognized in a manuscript or found in an on-line
	HTML encoded text.  I would like to see real ones rather than copying
	out of the Unicode samples.)
	
	Cyrillic Extended-B: Assembled Monograph Uk, uk.  See discussion
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uk_(Cyrillic)

2009-02-27 Stevan_White

2009-02-24 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Cherokee: Daniel improved U+13d2

	Sinhala: Copied most Unicode glyphs directly from Yannis Haralambous
	sinhala MetaFont files.  These are: all but 0dd0 0dd1 0df4.
	Gave Unicode characters names, based on a transliteration scheme from
	Harshula.
	The auxiliary Sinhala are all from the LKLUG font.

2009-02-23 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Copied glyphs from LKLUG font, as discussed with Harshula Jayasuriya.
	http://sinhala.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sinhala/sinhala/fonts/
	
	This font is derived from a Metafont font: This package was
	originally developed by Yannis Haralambous (Yannis.Haralambous at
	univ-lille1 fr), with funding from the Wellcome Institute for the
	History of Medicine, 183 Euston Road, London NW1 2BE, England (Contact
	person: Dominik Wujastyk (D.Wujastyk at ucl ac uk)), which is using
	the font in its Catalogue of Sinhala Manuscript. The original package
	was available by ftp at ftp.bcc.ac.uk in:
	/pub/users/ucgadkw/indology/software/sinhala1-TeX.zip
	
	The hope is to eventually pull glyphs directly from the original MF
	files.

2009-02-18 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Armenian: spacing changes
	Sinhala: deleted range, for usual reasons:
	It doesn't even contain the full set of Unicode letters, and Sinhala
	requires auxiliary characters and lookup tables for proper
	representation.

	Made omegas, omegas with titlo, and OT to all be of the same size and
	shape in Serif.
	Un-linked Cyrillic Psi and psi from Greek, made squarer versions.
	
	Some more Cyrillic diacritical marks in Sans.  Re-worked U+04bc-f .
	Experimenting with mark positioning for Cyrillic

	Strove to make Euro look more like the EC logo design, while making
	glyph fit better with the design of its face.  Bug #3576: Euro design
		https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?23576

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Adjustments mostly to GPOS tables having to do with Vietnamese marks.
	The WAZU Vietnamese test page looks pretty good in Sans now.
	Still not thrilled with below-dot when it appears with a mark over
	e.g. U+0102. Pango positions one or the other but not both.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Extensive modification of GPOS lookup tables for mark positioning.
	I think they're now all functional (except styled Mono faces have none).
	Also added lots of marks to faces that didn't have them, and also
	fiddled with Combining Diacritical Marks.

2008-11-10 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Made one combining mark really combining

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Made a few combining characters to be zero-width in Mono,
	Added them to other styles.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Figured out why below marks in Thai weren't working in the lowest
	letters.  I think Pango and other font renderers ignore 'blwm'. 
	However, 'mark' works.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Tweeks to Thai marks

2008-11-09 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Several bugfixes in Thai, mostly having to do with mark placement and
	ligatures.  Implemented ru-saraaa and lu-saraaa with ligatures.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	added and named dottedcircle (used by Pango to render
	combining mark base)

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Tweeks to Coptic, after viewing more papyrus samples and web pages.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Weight of Coptic small letters made to match that of Latin and Greek ones.

2008-11-08 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Made Coptic to comply better with
		http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Test_Coptic.html
	Made a flourish at foot of letters with long diagonal.

	More tweeks to Coptic; put in a mark lookup table.
	
	Note: for small letters I made scaled references to captials.
	Results in those letters looking quite light next to the capitals and
	next to small Latin letters.  Also, there are a few variant forms for
	capitals (Unicode samples don't show this).  It would be good to
	re-work

	Added Coptic alphabet in u+2C80-2CB1 and u+03E2-u+03EF, drawn/built by
	me, based on Unicode samples, TeX font copte, and scans at WikiPedia.

2008-11-07 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Further tweeks to dieresis in Greek and Cyrillic

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	replaced Greek I dieresis with references, tweeked height of dieresis.

2008-11-04 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added a few Cyrillic Extended-B letters seen in web pages while looking
	for Glagolitic text.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	Added a few old Cyrillic characters.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Several corrections and tweeks to Glagolitic.
	Still missing six slots from Unicode, but don't see them in the TeX
	fonts.
	On the other hand, several on-line Glagolitic pages (bibles etc) don't
	seem to use these.  Maybe it's OK as-is.

2008-11-03 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added lowercase range to Glagolitic, as a facile scaling of the
	uppercase.

	Added letter to Glagolitic, scaled range.

2008-11-02 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Replaced fraktur bold from Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols with that
	from TX Fonts by Young Ryu.
	One concern: letter k is damaged (in both medium and bold).  I just
	hacked something up.
	
	Added Glagolitic "round type" font (Croation capitols only) from the
	collection of Croatian fonts for LaTeX by Darko Zubrinić
	ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/languages/croatian/
	http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb17-1/tb50zubr.pdf
	
	Several letters are missing besides the small letters.

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	A couple of Thai references got obliqued twice.

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	By popular demand, removed 'ears' from Greek Upsilon and Psi.
	Copied resulting glyphs to Serif Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Some pointwise cleanup of main Tamil range

	Tried some things with lookups.  Didn't make much headway.

2008-11-01 Stevan_White
	* FreeMono.sfd:

	somehow made a letter with wrong width

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Added similar lookups and ligatures to Thai ranges.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Lookups now work no worse than those for other Thai fonts, at least
	in Pango.  Still perplexed by behaviour of "Required" lookups.

	For Thai, made ligatures and lookups for yoying and thothan combined
	with a lower vowel.  These work well.
	Attempted looksups for saraaa with ru and lu, and for saraam. 
	Not working.

	Cleaned up a few of the Bengali ligatures

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd:

	Tweek Thai

2008-10-31 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Fixed ligatures and mark positioning for Hanunóo.
	Problem with ligatures: Gnome pango doesn't do 'rlig', only 'liga'

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Changed lookup table scripts for Devanagari and Bengali.
	Find Problems -> ATT found several problems showing lookups acting on
	glyphs that weren't listed in the script ranges, including dev2, bng2
	(why not deva and beng, I don't know).
	
	danda and doubledanda of Devanagari I understand are to be shared among
	Indic scripts.  So included bng2 and dev2 in the 'aalt' table for those.
	
	The 'init' and 'half' tables for Bengali made active for bng2.
	
	The 'locl' table for Bengali didn't do anything I could see: It mapped
	the Devanagari danda to itself, and the doubledanda to itself.  Deleted.

	Cleaned up some kern tables.
	adjustments of under 5 EM are invisible.  Some others I just didn't like.
	Some were putting a letter beneath another, with is wrong.

	* FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd:

	Added Thai

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Changes to mark positioning lookups, esp. in Italic.
	Widened numerals in Bold

2008-10-27 Stevan_White
	* FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Tweeks regarding Armenian and lookups

	* FreeSansBold.sfd:

	Added Armenian ligatures FB13-FB17 with lookups
	Also made a historical ligature ('hlig') table for u+0587.
	
	Toward bug #15183: missing characters from Armenian range
	https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?15183

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Added Armenian ligatures, lookups.  Cleaned up contours.

	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Added 5 Armenian ligatures to U+FB13 – FB17, and made corresponding
	'liga' lookup.  Found there one ligature u+0587 that according to
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_alphabet
	
	"in new orthography the և character is not a typographical ligature anymore, and must never be treated as such. It is a distinct letter and has its place in the new alphabetic sequence."
	So moved this out of the 'liga' lookup and into a new 'hlig' lookup.

2008-10-26 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Lots of improvements to Thai.
	Completely revised letter spacing in Italic, and fiddled with combining
	marks in all.
	Still aren't working quite right, especially in Italic.
	Still need to work over digits (in Bold they aren't even bold yet)

	* FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Bold Thai : added (painstakingly) constructed glyphs, lookups
	roman Thai: tweeks
	Italic Thai: tweeks (Note this still has multiple problems)

2008-10-25 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	WAZU says
	http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Hanunoo.html
	
	MPH 2B Damase doesn't support the consonant-vowel ligatures necessary
	to render Buhid writing.
	
	OK, so I made 'mark' lookups for combining marks and a bunch of
	ligatures in an 'rlig' lookup.  The latter still not working:
	don't know why.
	
	Made page to match the example of the combining forms at
	http://www.omniglot.com/writing/hanunoo.htm

2008-10-24 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Removed some marks from Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Note:  Serious problem with Sans GPOS abvm in Devanagari
	"'abvm' Above Base Mark in Devanagari subtable" "gujr-0"
	But all the characters that list gujr-0 are in Gujarati.
	Not sure how this got broken or how to fix it.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Fiddled with Thai mark positioning: passes my tests now OK.

	and correspond better with TeX.
	Tweek of serif.

	* FreeSansBold.sfd:

	a few more improvements.
	
	One problem with the Mathematical Alphanumeric area is, one must
	remember to change it any time another face is altered...

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd:

	Several improvements and additions to Sans faces (mostly in Greek) from

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Wrote script to check if glyph encodings were in stated ranges, fixed
	most discrepancies.
	
	There were a bunch of incompletely deleted characters in several faces.
	
	Sans: found several other problems in the process
	# Tamil
	Four slots labelled 0BDA-D have glyphs, not in Unicode.  also 0BE1
	I think they are misplaced; added 0010 to each of them
	
	# Devanagari
	Slot labelled U+093B is not in Unicode--can't find glyph: deleted
	likewise 094F (may have been meant to be 0954)
	0955, 0973-0976
	
	0954 should be a combining mark, but it appears on the wrong side of 0.
	0971 was just wrong--made into simple dot.
	0972 is also wrong--made my own Candra A.
	
	# Gujarati
	Slots labelled 0AE4-5 are not in Unicode; seem not to belong at all.
	Deleted.  2800 is a dup of 2790.  Deleted
	
	Serif: phillipine_double u1736 was misplaced
	
	A bunch of the Math Alphanumeric symbols are empty in the standard,
	because they're represented elsewhere.  These should be deleted
	First need to make style consistent with existing symbols.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Applied patch from Daniel J
	Remedies bug
		FreeSerif: Missing glyphs with palatal hook
		https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?24298

	Re-encoded.
	Deleted several glyphs in Hebrew Alphabetic Presentation Forms that
	didn't correspond valid Unicode

	Ran script to find mis-numbered glyphs.  Several were simply typos,
	some offset by one.

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Numerous cases of glyphs in Private Use area incorrectly assigned
	Unicode numbers and names.  Gave all -1 for Unicode and named like
	"slot.XXXX".

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Adapted Mahjong Tiles from George Douros' Unicode Symbols font.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Added Domino Tiles.  Domino outline is copied from George Douros'

	* tools/ranges.py:

	corrected and simplified calculation of whether OS/2 bit is set.
	Now works mostly perfectly, except for some high Unicode ranges...

	(FontForge complains though)

	* tools/GenerateTrueType:

	Made to hint before instructing: FontForge bases TT instructions on hints
	although hints are not put into TrueType fonts.

	* tools/hex_range.py:

	cosmetic tweek

	* tools/isMonoMono.py:

	re-worked to take a list of files as input

	* tools/ranges.py:

	re-structured code and corrected a few ranges

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Adapted Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols from George Douros' Unicode
	Symbols font.

	* FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd:

	This one got away from me--I don't know what I did.
	Looks like some small contour edits.

	* FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd:

	Fixed one mis-numberd character in Latin Extended-B

	* FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Fixed several mis-numbered characters.

	* FreeSansBold.sfd:

	SansBold: one Georgian letter with no name, one Zapf Dingbat was
	unnumbered
	ATT test shows a bunch of problems with Gurmukhi and 'blwf' table
	indeed shows those letters at 0x10000+
	Sans names them like uni0A30_uni0A4D.blwf: they are in range
	ECC6 to ED06
	
	I meant to move this range into Private Use in last release, and
	missed it.  So now it is moved, into same range as Sans.
	
	Both Sans and SansBold in nukt table for Gurmukhi have duplicate
	entries for uni0A15 uni0A3C.  Deleted dups.

	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd:

	fixed a number of Unassigned Code Points in Greek Extended

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	mis-numbered Combining Diacritics

	* FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Several chars in Latin Extended hadn't been named.
	One spurious letter in Letterlike Symbols

2008-09-16 Stevan_White
	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Lots of additions: unless otherwise noted, they are from George Duros'
	fonts Analecta, Music, and Unicode (haven't got final confirmation of
	the eligibility of these glyphs, so this is just for testing.)
	
	Added some combining marks, fiddled a bit.  In both Serif & Mono, tried
	to get a key symbol characters to fit inside the key combining mark
	
	Serif
	Got rid of ears on Upsilon
	Added:
	        # Gothic
		# Western & Byzantine Musical Symbols
	
		# Misc Symbols, Misc Technical Symbols (drew many myself)
		# Supplemental Symbols and Arrows
	
	Mono
	Added:
		# lotsa Misc Technical Symbols
		# OCR Symbols
		# drew many Supplemental Symbols and Arrows, Misc Technical
	
	Sans
	Added	# Phoenecian
	Made a few Letterlike Symbols; Made Re and Im to be sans-serif.

	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Removed pointless entries from Latin kern table
	
	Tidied points in Sinhala

2008-09-07 Stevan_White
	* FreeSerif.sfd:

	Tidied up Tamil ligatures EEA8-EEAB to fix TT build warning
		"MonotonicFindAlong: Never found our spline."

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, Makefile:

	
	Added APL characters to FreeMono (why?...)
	
	Fixed several last-minute problems, including
	
	Serif: Tweeked GPOS mark table for Cyrillic
	Sans: Added a GPOS table for Cyrillic (but several diacritics missing)
	
	Serif, Mono: tweeked some bugs in extensible brackets & integrals
	
	Serif: Vietnamese o circumflex: accent was a bit high. fixed.
	
	MonoBoldOblique OTF build
		uni213b intersects self
	
	Generation of TT fonts complains about several things to stderr,
	including:
	
	SerifBold: "There exists a 'fpgm' code that seems incompatible with FontForge's. Instructions generated will be of lower quality. If legacy hinting is to be scrapped, it is suggested to clear the `fpgm` and repeat autoinstructing. It will be then possible to append user's code to FontForge's 'fpgm', but due to possible future updates, it is extremely advised to use high numbers for user's functions."
	Probably has been there since I first copied the TT instructions in. 
	Just repeated the copying process carefully, and the warning went away.
	
	Serif:  "FindMatchingHVEdge fell into an impossible position"
	        fixed a bunch of point too close
	
	REMAINING PROBLEM in Serif TT build
		"MonotonicFindAlong: Never found our spline."
		        fixed several bad TT matrices-- there are several more
			fixed many "control points too close" no luck

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Added/corrected some Misc. Symbols by copying from Serif.
	Note this is only a stopgap solution.  Want real sans-serif symbols.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBold.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Added minimal Miscellaneous Symbols: card suites and some musical notes.
	Note not happy with shapes...some I just drew.  Sans isn't really sans.
	
	Fixed one APL symbol in Mono so it verified in OTF version

2008-08-31 Stevan_White
	* FreeMono.sfd:

	Built set of APL symbols.

2008-08-30 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Un-linked references in uni02B2 and uni02B5, because when validating the
	TrueType version, FontForge gave an error "is drawn in wrong direction".
	I suspect a bug in FontForge.  Other similar glyphs make no errors.

	Fixed missing extrema in TrueType.
	These were the last cases being reported by validate in all the faces.

	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	fixed last missing extrema in TrueType

	* Makefile:

	restructured validation to look in a directory

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd:

	Fixed missing extrema in TrueType versions

	* isMonoMono.py, validate.py:

	restructured validation to look in a directory

2008-08-15 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd:

	Same problem with uni0A83 as with bn_llikaar.  Just made zero-width.

2008-08-14 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd:

	Glyph bn_llikaar, U+09E3 BENGALI VOWEL SIGN VOCALIC LL,
	has right bound positioned far into the negative.  Causes a warning in
	FontForge when opening OTF version.
	Comparing with other fonts supporting Bengali, found no others that
	do this.
	Serif makes glyph width 0 (which sounds right according to Unicode)
	and puts glyph wholly to left of 0.  But, I haven't found this letter
	in text anywhere.  I wonder if it is really used in writing.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Further TrueType validation fixes. 
	Sans still has two glyps in wrong direction.

	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Fixed more TrueType problems...all missing extrema in TTF validation

2008-08-13 Stevan_White
	* FreeSans.sfd, FreeSansOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifBold.sfd, FreeSerifBoldItalic.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	fixed all the TrueType validation problems of type "intersects itself"
	and all but two of the "wrong directions", as well as a lot of
	"missing extrema".  But there remain hundreds of missing extrema in the
	TrueType version.
	Also, bn_llikaar in Sans and Oblique still has a problem in OTF version.

	* FreeMono.sfd, FreeMonoBoldOblique.sfd, FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSansBold.sfd, FreeSansBoldOblique.sfd:

	Made .ttf files to validate.  Other faces have many more problems still.

2008-08-12 Stevan_White
	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd, FreeSerif.sfd, FreeSerifItalic.sfd:

	Continuing to make OTF versions validate.
	
	* FreeMonoOblique.sfd:
		lots of missing points at extrema
	* FreeSerif.sfd:
		12 wrong directions, 1 missing extrema
	* FreeSerifItalic.sfd:
		many missing points at extrema, 1 self-intersecting
	
	What was wrong: in several oblique cases, an already-italic glyph was
	made more italic, thereby fouling up extrema (although why it passed
	validation in the SFD I don't know).  Some glyphs were
	overly-complicated with many near points.  Cleaned up, rounded to int.
	
	Remaining problem: OTF FreeSansOblique FreeSans. one Bengali glyph in
	each whose advan
